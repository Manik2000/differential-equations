# Modeling Echo Chambers and Polarization Dynamics in Social Networks

Implementation of the paper [Modeling Echo Chambers and Polarization Dynamics in Social Networks](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.048301) by Fabian Baumann, Philipp Lorenz-Spreen, Igor M. Sokolov, and Michele Starnini.

The description of the model can be found inside the original paper but also in our presentation (`diffusion_project.pdf`).
The presentation was given as part of the course *Diffusion Processes on Complex Networks* at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

All analysis and simulations are performed in the Jupyter Notebook `echo_chambers.ipynb`.
The code is written in Python.

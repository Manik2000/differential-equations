# diff_equ_proj

In this project we describe how differential equations may turn out to be useful in modelling
interspecific interactions, such as predation or mutualism.

We also implemented the Runge-Kutta 4th order method and Euler method for solving
systems of differential equations. 

All code is written in Julia.
